The continuation code dependency structure is as follows:

continue.sh > {init.sh,equil.sh,run.sh} > {hoomd_init.py,...,hoomd_run.py} > {init.in,equil.in,run.in}

To run a simulation, populate init.in...run.in with appropriate params for the hoomd py scripts EXCEPT for "restart" param...
this is automatically generated by continue.sh. Then simply execute continue.sh.
