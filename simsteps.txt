Steps to set up and run simulation:
1. Initialize simulation and set integrator
2. Initialize system state from file
3. Set up Writer to write trajectories
4. Set up Updater to tune trial move size
5. Run simulation - [simname].run([#ofsteps])

Steps to create randomized initial state:
1. Define number of particles
2. Define particle placement and set up periodic box
3. Write configuration to file
4. Set up a simulation and integrator, initialize system state from file
5. Run simulation until system is randomized
6. Write new configuration to file
7. Set up a simulation and integrator, initialize system state from file
8. Set up QuickCompress Updater and add so Simulation
9. Set up MoveSize Tuner and add to Simulation
10. Run simulation until QuickCompress completes (check to see if it is complete)
11. Write final configuration to file
